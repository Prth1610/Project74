      <p class="text-muted">The St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church is new American Gothic Style church in the prairie landscape on the edge of the bustling college town of Stillwater, Okla. The architect for the church Franck & Lohsen Architects, designed color palate of the exterior brick veneer and precast limestone consistent with indigenous stone of the region that has a range of brown and red. A custom blend of five different brick colors is used for the exterior veneer.

        The manufactured precast limestone was specified in the project for large size spires, detailed arches, window ornamentation, bandings, cornices, wall coping, architectural trim, etc. to achieve the desired end user experience and aesthetic appeal.
        
        The church is crowned with a pair of towers and spires with the cross on the tallest spire reaching the height of 157, making it visible for several miles.
        
        The designers had developed detailed large size profiles with precise, intricate design details to give the building a level of ornamentation appropriate for an American Gothic church. The AAS team worked closely with the architect and contractor for the project early in the design phase to review CAD drawings and confirm design feasibility."</p>

      <p class="text-muted">HCP Group has a long history of providing honorary professional services St. Xavier's High School, Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad.  The design brief was Interior Design for the new auditorium space “for varied types of performances” and one that can accommodate a large proportion of the 1,200 pupils.  Our key design aim was to ensure enough flexibility to accommodate a range of school activities and stage performances.  We also needed to make sure that the fixtures and fitting were durable enough to withstand expected wear and tear of a bustling school environment.  The lighting and sound systems were designed to allow for different configurations.  To optimize seating capacity we chose to use bench based seating, which also contributed to the informal ambiance.  Highly durable materials were preferred wherever necessary and rays of vibrant colors added to a sense of warmth and comfort. The outcome was an efficient and smart yet informal environment.  For HCPID it was also an exercise in exploring ways in which the scope for interior design and services can be stretched to accommodate communication or entertainment in built form.
